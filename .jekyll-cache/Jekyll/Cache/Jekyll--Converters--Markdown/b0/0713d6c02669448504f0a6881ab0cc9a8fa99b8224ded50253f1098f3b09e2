<p>We are in 2021 and password security remains elusive. Many users find it difficult to remember passwords and, because of this, use same passwords to log in to multiple sites or products. As you can imagine, this opens users and your organization up to a security breach. Instead, it is recommended using a password management tool, such as Last Pass or 1Password, with 2FA enabled and a 15-minute timeout, to eliminate the need to remember passwords and increase the likelihood of individuals using very secure, randomized passwords.</p>

<p>Instead of also creating a random string of characters to protect the password management tool, users should be educated and changed over to passphrases - longer, but easily memorable phrases such as ‚Äúthe peach cobbler at cowboy chicken is great‚Äù that unlocks the password management tool. To enable passphrases, you may need to change your password policy and complexity to a minimum of 25-30 characters with no requirement on usage of case, numbers, or symbols.</p>
