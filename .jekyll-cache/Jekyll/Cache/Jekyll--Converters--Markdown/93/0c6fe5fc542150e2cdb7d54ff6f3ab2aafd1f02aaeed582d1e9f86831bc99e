<p>Letâ€™s warm up by taking a look at what cookies look like. Try to look and inspect them a few different ways.</p>

<h4 id="1-using-burp">1. Using Burp</h4>

<p>Go to facebook.com, and look at the request header in Burp. As you can see, multiple cookies are sent with each request. The cookies are sent as a single string, where each cookie is a key-value pair, separated by semicolons.</p>

<p>Go to Chrome settings. In the search box in the upper right, type â€œcookiesâ€. Click â€œContent Settingsâ€ and then â€œAll cookies and site dataâ€. Search for â€œFacebookâ€ and look at the cookies there. Click on one of the cookies. Each cookie comes with some meta data.</p>
