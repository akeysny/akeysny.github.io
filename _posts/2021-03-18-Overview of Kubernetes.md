# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is the world's most famous open-source container orchestration engine. It offers the ability to schedule and manage containers-Docker or otherwise-at scale. First, we will learn how to get a Kubernetes environment up and running, and understand the components. We will deploy a sample Kubernetes application and manage it with Kubernetes Dashboard. We will leave the most exciting part for the end; authentication and authorization.

## Getting up and running: Mac install

1. Setup all prerequisites for minikube (Docker and Virtualbox)
2. Setup and test Minikube
3. Setup and test kubectl

### Setup Prerequisities

#### Docker:

* Download links for Docker for Windows: [`Windows`](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)
* Download links for Docker for Linux: [`Linux`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu)

### Setup Kubectl:
* Download link: [`Kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-via-curl)

Command to test: `kubectl version`

### Setup Minikube:
* General Download Instructions: [`Here`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
* Download link: [`Here`](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases)

Command to test: `minikube version`

We see hear that it loads up the Workload Status. We can also look at Deployments here ->

This page just gives us an overview what we have running in our cluster

We will look into our Deployments and we notice that we could edit our deployment if we wanted to. We could update a deployment (not recommended).

We can scale a resource

We will notice here that additional pods are coming up.

We notice that these new pods just came up online

Thatâ€™s great.

You can also go inside of the pod window
